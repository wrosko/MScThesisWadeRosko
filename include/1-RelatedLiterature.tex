\chapter{Related Literature}

This chapter reviews some relevant literature and techniques that are referenced and utilized in this thesis. First, the basis behind guilds \citep{Goldford2018} and systems biology chemical flux is presented .  Then, the SparCC \citep{Friedman2012} and FastSpar \citep{Watts2018} algorithms will be introduced, followed by the case and control network comparison technique from NetShift \citep{Kuntal2018}. Additionally, the MicrobiomeHD project \citep{Duvallet2017} will be discussed....\textbf{Discuss first?} 

\textbf{discuss what the network statistics can tell us about microbial network}
